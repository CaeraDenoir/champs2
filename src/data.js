Mist fuels her Relic Cannon's power with increased Attack Damage, Attack Range, and Critical Strike Chance. Attacks from Senna's Relic Cannon take longer to fire, deal bonus damage, and briefly grant her a portion of her target's Move Speed.",

            e_desc:"Senna draws the Mist she has stored in her weapon into a storm around her, embracing darkness and becoming a wraith within. Allies who enter the area are camouflaged and also appear as wraiths as the Mist shrouds them. Wraiths gain increased Move Speed, are unselectable, and hide their identities.",
